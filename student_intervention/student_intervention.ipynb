Decisions Trees are most valuable because they are transparent and their results are explained easily. Other models like Nerual Networks produce results which are difficult to explain. Decision trees are also good at working with both categorical and numerical data, which in a mixed input situation such as this project is useful. The flaws of Decision Trees come from two threats. Overly complex models can be built that overfit the training data. The next flaw is that Decision Trees can become trapped in local maxima in terms of error. The attractiveness of this algorithm for this problem is its transparency. Actions like student intervention need to be justified. If a student wants to know why they were selected for intervention the professor or administrator should be able to explain that to them. I am also not so worried about overfitting because the sorts of things that cause students to be doing worse are expected to be the same in a larger population.**\n",

    "**SVM: Its out of the box ready for binary classification. Its commonly used in trading, https://www.r-bloggers.com/trading-with-support-vector-machines-svm/ . It seems somewhat capable of dealing with high dimensionality. The major flaw is that it is a black box method, and its output is difficult to test or explain. Another problem is that the threat of overfitting has been moved to the kernel selection aspect of setting up the svm.  Another issue with SVMs is that they are computationally expensive. So on large scales it could be prohibitive to use them. The main reason to use an SVM is that it can learn to model non-linear data using the \"Kernel Trick\", which given the ammount of features in this data set seems like a great possibility.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**GaussianNB: Gaussian Naive Bayes doesn't overfit and is good at making good guesses at outcomes from a dataset. It is used in text analysis for things like spam filtering. Google uses something like this for spam filtering. The problem with Naive Bayes is that it can't capture relationships between features. It basically assumes features which are independent of one another, which is why it is called \"naive\". GaussianNB classifiers work on probabilities, and when it comes to students graduating or failing it does make sense to model in terms of probability. Specifically GaussianNB classifiers work on Bayesian statistics, which has a particular interperetation of probability which is useful to machine learning. By assmbling these many features we can ask how likely it would be for someone with each of those features to pass or fail. We then combine likeliness of each of thsoe features with the probability that any person would pass or fail to figure out whether we think someone will pass or fail. This is a good approach because it directly answers with mathematics \"Who is likely to not graduate?\" directly. In short, it seems like a good possible model because it answers the question we are asking the most directly.**"

Students with educated but low income parents (Community College Professors) may be more mixed along with students with parents who have high income but low education (Immigrant Small Business Owners) may be more mixed. The SVMs will train on which students with those features pass and fail and then draw a boudnary. When it makes a a prediction, it will look at the features of the student, and then plot the student on the model. If Mr.Vasquez parents only recieved primary school education in Venezuela, but managed to start a Laundry Matt chain in Canada over the last ten years, we would plot him on low educational attainment and high income for his parents. If he is above or right of the Margin, then he will be predicted to be passing, whereas if he is on the lower or left side of the boundary, he will be predicted to be failing. ** \n",

It has an important feature called the Kernel trick to represent more complicated data. When students are being plotted on 30 dimensions and don't always conform to expectations, negative or positive, it is important to be able to capture the complexity of the model. This can be done by translating from higher dimensional space into a non-linear function which can draw shapes around different groups of people and classify them. So if it turns out that middle class kids are better students, but rich and poor students have different problems preventing them from succeeding, it is possible for the algorithm to draw a circle in the center around the middle income children and separate the rich and poor children along with any other confounding factors.  **"
